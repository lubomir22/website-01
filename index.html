                    At age 14-18 years I was involved in football 
                    My team twice took the first place in the district championship.  
                    In my spare time try to get together with  friends and have some fun.

                    One of my favorite types of rest is a hike to the mountain for a few days.

                A few words about Berlin.I was living and working there for half of year.
                I have only good memories left. Very clean city with fascinating history and architecture.

                Stockholm has left only pleasant memories I lived there for 3 months.
                A very cool city, which strikes a combination of water and stone.
